## Release 0 - Nutritional Table

Understand how to work with AJAX and files located in your product. In this exercise, we are going to pull information from another file into our website using AJAX. 

- Create an empty webpage.
- Place `nutrition.xml` in your project folder.
- Use AJAX via jQuery or JS API to fetch the file into the page.
- Create a table. For each `<food>` in the XML file, create a row in the table with the food name and nutritional facts - serving size, calories, carbs.


## Release 1 : Sorting data on our webpage 
- We want to be able to sort the data we have added to our webpage.
- Use the `tablesorter` jQuery plugin to make the table sortable by the nutritional facts.
